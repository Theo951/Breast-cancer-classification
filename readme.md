In this project I will try to perform classification on the sk-learn dataset called "breast_cancer".
The objective is to try to recreate the work presented in the paper A Mathematical Programming Based Procedure for Breast Cancer Classification by implementing OR methods together with machine learning approaches such as kMeans.
