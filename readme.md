In this project I will try to perform classification on the sk-learn dataset called "breast_cancer".
The objective is to try to implement techniques presented in the paper "A Mathematical Programming Based Procedure for Breast Cancer Classification" by implementing OR methods together with machine learning approaches such as kMeans. Regardless of the results it will prove an interesting excercise to test  programming skills and to apply OR techniques together with more classical data science approaches. The objective is not to beat state of the art approaches, but to experiment ideas that I do not see often in my own experience.
