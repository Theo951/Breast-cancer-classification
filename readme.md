In this project I will try to perform classification on the sk-learn dataset called "breast_cancer".
The objective is to try to recreate the work presented in the paper "A Mathematical Programming Based Procedure for Breast Cancer Classification" by implementing OR methods together with machine learning approaches such as kMeans.
